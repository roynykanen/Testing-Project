> Please use the below questions as guidelines to help you think and plan your Learning Reflection Report

## 1. How was your experience testing the given Webapp?
- Testing the given GitLab web application was a valuable and hands-on experience. It allowed me to understand how different test scenarios apply in a real-world web platform, especially with user flows related to project and issue management.
     

## 2. How did you write or manage your test case? Describe the process.
- Each test case included preconditions, clear steps, and expected results. Variables were used to store test data to ensure reusability and consistency. I grouped similar actions and reused navigation or login steps to maintain readability.
    

## 3. Do you recommend any other tools or styles for Test case management. 
 - No, I don't have any hands-on experience with any other tools or styles for Test case management.    


## 4. Which IDE (Visual Code or Atom or else) have you used to edit files?
- I used Visual Studio Code (VS Code) for editing the test files. 

     
## 5. Did you find any trouble? how did you solve the trouble?
- No, I didn't find any trouble.


## 6. Did you find any trouble using Github? have you used Github before? where?
- I didn’t face any trouble using GitHub, as I have used it before in several school projects.
 

## 7. If in the future if you need to automate these test cases, which framework or language will you use? and describe why (Robot Framework, Cypress, Selenium, or any other )
- I would choose Robot Framework for this kind of UI-based functional testing because it's beginner-friendly and supports keyword-driven testing.


## 8. Kindly search the term `Tester` `Automation Tester` glassdoor and LinkedIn or any other job search website. Currently, list the skills and competencies that are most in-demand in software testing
- API Testing (Postman, REST)
- SQL and database validation
- Version control (Git)
- CI/CD tools (Jenkins, GitHub Actions)
- Java, Python, or JavaScript knowledge
- Test case management (TestRail, Jira)


## 9. **Let's assume** that if you are going to continue with the career in Software Testing, which technical and soft skills do you need to fill up the blank in your resume?
- Technical skills: Robot Framework, Python or Java for scripting, API testing with Postman, Docker basics, and CI/CD pipelines
- Soft skills: Clear documentation, test strategy planning, agile teamwork, and reporting test results effectively


## 10. Write short Learning Reflection and  Free words Do you think that project helped in putting theoretical knowledge into practice? Describe? (is there anything else that you would like to share with us concerning the current study module). e.g. regarding the quality of content and your learning (or) improvement ideas? 
- This project definitely helped put theoretical knowledge into practice. Writing test cases for real-world functionalities like project creation or issue tracking in GitLab helped me understand how to think from a tester’s perspective. It improved my understanding of test planning, scenario writing, and error handling. Overall, the study module was practical.
